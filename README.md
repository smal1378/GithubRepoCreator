Ver 1.0:<br>
- This version of code is written to just do the main use of this project. This means it is not for public use.
- "token.txt" is a simple file that your GitHub token should be there.
- After running "controller.py" if the "token.txt" isn't present in the same directory it'll ask for token. <br>
Then you should enter how many repos should be created. <br>
After that it'll ask for organization name and a file name (optional) that contains a list of usernames to be
invited with "maintain" role to each repository, each line is for one repository starting from first line and 
each username is separated using a ",".
